# development diary for timesheet app

* [0527.2002 03:59] goal
I want to make a simple timesheet app WITHOUT using my 
libraries. Then I will refactor. The hope is that I can
see what is working and what is not.

* [0527.2002 04:52] got it.
A little less than an hour later, I've got a 100-line timesheet
app, that lets you add, edit, and delete rows in a single table.
I'll check this in to CVS now.
