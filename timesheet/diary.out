# development diary for timesheet app

* [0527.2002 03:59] goal
I want to make a simple timesheet app WITHOUT using my 
libraries. Then I will refactor. The hope is that I can
see what is working and what is not.

* [0527.2002 04:52] got it.
A little less than an hour later, I've got a 100-line timesheet
app, that lets you add, edit, and delete rows in a single table.
I'll check this in to CVS now. [timesheet.app 1.1.1.1]

* [0527.2002 05:46] refactoring
Okay, I'm back. The original version covers the basics, but there's
still a lot of grunt work to be done and situations that it doesn't
handle. And the code is just plain ugly.

* [0527.2002 05:50] step 1: outsource the HTML
We can replace the code of showForm(...) with a zebra template.
...
Done. It brought us down to 80 lines, and broke the app into
three files.
