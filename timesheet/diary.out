# development diary for timesheet app

* [0527.2002 03:59] goal
I want to make a simple timesheet app WITHOUT using my 
libraries. Then I will refactor. The hope is that I can
see what is working and what is not.

* [0527.2002 04:52] got it.
A little less than an hour later, I've got a 100-line timesheet
app, that lets you add, edit, and delete rows in a single table.
I'll check this in to CVS now. [timesheet.app 1.1.1.1]

* [0527.2002 05:46] refactoring
Okay, I'm back. The original version covers the basics, but there's
still a lot of grunt work to be done and situations that it doesn't
handle. And the code is just plain ugly.

* [0527.2002 05:50] step 1: outsource the HTML
We can replace the code of showForm(...) with a zebra template.
...
Done. It brought us down to 80 lines, and broke the app into
three files.

* [0527.2002 06:07] step 2: outsource the SQL
We got rid of the HTML, but we've still got SQL all
through the code. It's not even safe SQL, because we
didn't do error checking. For example, what happens
if someone tries to put "cat" in for the number of
hours? Or includes a single quote in one of the fields?
Both will cause a nasty error!

Let's bypass all that and use the storage module instead.
....
Done. That was easy enough. Just made a few little changes,
plus I had to compensate a little bit and:
  - convert the ID on the querystring to an int
  - strip out junk from the input on save

I also made a few small formatting changes to form.zb

We're down to 54 lines, and it's all python. Things
are looking brighter now.

* [0527.2002 06:31] refactor!
