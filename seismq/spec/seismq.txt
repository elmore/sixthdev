
h1. seismq: sei's messaging queue

p. This module provides a simple message queue based on SQLite.

h2. opening the queue

p. The open() method opens the queue database, 
   creating it if necessary:

bc[python]. 
    >>> import seismq
    >>> mq = seismq.open('test/mqlite.mq')


h2. sending a message

p. Messages are simple strings for now.
   @TODO: pickle arbitrary arguments for messages.

bc[python].
    >>> mq.send('genhttpconf')


h2. taking messages

p. The take() method returns a list of all matching 
   messages and removes them from the queue.

bc[python].
    >>> mq.take('genhttpconf')
    ['genhttpconf']
    >>> mq.take('genhttpconf')
    []


h2. closing the queue

bc[python].
    >>> mq.close()
