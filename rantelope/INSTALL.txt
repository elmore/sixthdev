PREREQUISITES 
(all of these are preinstalled at cornerhost)

  - python 2.2 (maybe other versions)
  - pysqlite (or MySQLdb)
  - the sabren libraries:
      - arlo      (object/relational mapping)
      - pytypes   (various types)
      - strongbox (static typing and other fun stuff)
      - weblib    (web server abstraction layer)
      - storage   (storage abstraction layer)
      - handy     (misc routines)
      - sixthday  (generic web applications)
      - zebra     (template/reporting system)

    You can get all of these in one tarball here:

      http://rantelope.com/download/sabrenlibs.tgz

  - a webserver configured to process *.app files
    through weblib. This isn't terribly complicated
    if your webserver supports CGI, but the docs are
    pretty sketchy, so if you need help, ask.

INSTALLATION

  - unzip the rantelope files to a directory 
    on your website. (eg: ~/web/domain.com/rantelope)
 
  - Make the directory writable by the web server. 
    [This will not be required for future versions]
    (eg: chmod o+w rantelope)

  - create the database. For now, that looks like this:

    chdir rantelope
    sed -e"s/not null auto_increment//" rantelope.sql | sqlite blog.rdb
    chmod o+w blog.rdb

  - load rantelope.app in your browser and try it out!
