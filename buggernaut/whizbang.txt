7:04 PM 2/16/01 we're off! check existing zikeplan sources into cvs
7:10 PM 2/16/01 finally checked out latest versions (after figuring out where it was)
		setting off to create new database schema, based on old schema
7:13 PM 2/16/01 debating whether project/area ought to really be a hierarchy.
7:15 PM 2/16/01 decided to ditch bug_target table, since this is redundant with dates..
7:17 PM 2/16/01 realize buggernaut, zikeplan, and msdc are one and same!!!
		will call tables bug_ so as not to conflict with old tables : FOR NOW!
7:18 PM 2/16/01 changed my mind..
7:20 PM 2/16/01 add risk/reward on scale of 1..10
7:21 PM 2/16/01 plan_goal_task, so goals and tasks are *:*
7:23 PM 2/16/01 high winds coming through.. check TV in case I'm about to wind up in kansas.
7:26 PM 2/16/01 big storm has passed.. this one is just minor. no worries.
7:26 PM 2/16/01 crap! almost a half hour has gone by!
7:29 PM 2/16/01 came up with task_history idea to track changes.. decided to veto for now.
7:31 PM 2/16/01 grab base_user, base_contact table from zikebase (sixthday)
7:32 PM 2/16/01 wondering why i even have user.UID, since it's never used..
7:33 PM 2/16/01 base plan_task_note on base_content 
                (could..should? inhert, but 1:1 is-a relationships suck in zdc right now)
7:36 PM 2/16/01 looking over db schema. I'm happy. let's go.
7:38 PM 2/16/01 posted update to sabren.net.. installing DB.
7:41 PM 2/16/01 fixed bugs in sql, imported tables.
7:43 PM 2/16/01 checked in to cvs.. NOW! to create the app.
7:44 PM 2/16/01 grabbed generic module.zb (sixthday) - not much in it, but oh well
7:44 PM 2/16/01 wrote sqlPlan (based on sqlTest.py) to connect to db.
7:45 PM 2/16/01 decided to make generic script to generate my recordsets
7:48 PM 2/16/01 realized generator would take a little more work than I want to do.. 
7:51 PM 2/16/01 save copies of sixthday template for Goal, Task, Status, Note, Type
7:52 PM 2/16/01 fill in templates, add to __init__ (wish I had classfile working)
7:54 PM 2/16/01 making Goal a subclass of zikebase.Node (and griping about zikebase.load)
7:55 PM 2/16/01 some asshole is outside honking his horn.. debating killing him.
7:55 PM 2/16/01 looking at zikebase.Node... realizing I need to extend plan_goal to
                include the Node-like fields for hierarchy.
7:58 PM 2/16/01 note to self: base_node has useless fields.. (or my sql dump is old)
8:00 PM 2/16/01 debating whether to rename goal.name to .label -> I'll worry about it later.
8:02 PM 2/16/01 checked in new sql... updating blog.
8:05 PM 2/16/01 goal turns out to be just straight copy of node for now: so.. no test
8:06 PM 2/16/01 Note: subclass Content .. default taskID to 0...
                thought about adding accessor for task, 
                but not sure i need it... so again, no tests.
8:10 PM 2/16/01 thinking there ought to be a generic Label class for Status, Type..
8:11 PM 2/16/01 considering renaming status, type to StatusLabel, TypeLabel
                also maybe creating a naming scheme.. eg, plan_ref_status.. not sure.
                decided not to for now.
8:13 PM 2/16/01 saved Status.py as Type.py and did search/replace (only 17 lines..)
8:14 PM 2/16/01 start working on Task.
8:16 PM 2/16/01 task has CreateStamp.. setting self._data['createDate'] = zdc.TIMESTAMP
                .. but not really sure if it's right.
8:18 PM 2/16/01 added @TODO: should goals also have target and create dates? I think so.
8:19 PM 2/16/01 renamed hrsElapsed to hrsElap for consistency.. 
                status => statusID .. 
                made typeID, statusID ints (were varchars accidentally)
8:23 PM 2/16/01 putting off handling notes until I get a basic app running.
8:23 PM 2/16/01 updatin cvs
8:29 PM 2/16/01 updated blog.
8:29 PM 2/16/01 thinking about how to present this data:
                - Type and Status are the same for all projects at the moment, 
                  so they should be edited in a systemwide admin area, if at all.
                - Users should have access to add, edit, and comment on tasks.
                - some bug lists (goals) should be public (read only)
                - others public with add permissions for nonusers
                - others password protected 
                - can always do fancier permission stuff later.

                SO:
		   - submit task (bug/challenge/request/whatever) screen [for public]
                   - add/edit task [for users]
                   - show tasks for a goal
                   - show all tasks for user, grouped by goal
                   - advanced query/reporting (??)

8:38 PM 2/16/01 updating blog..
8:41 PM 2/16/01 taking a break. I'm starving.
9:10 PM 2/16/01 back. updating blog with ideas.
9:14 PM 2/16/01 thinking about how to lay out admin side...
                had idea for Auth that could authenticate against .htpasswd files..
9:21 PM 2/16/01 planning admin app for users, types, goals.
                wondering whether goals should be in public area. 
                I think they should be, and that each user should have own goals.
                But that's out of scope. For now, goals are set by admin.
9:23 PM 2/16/01 setting out to create admin app.
9:23 PM 2/16/01 copy generic adminapp.py as admin/index.py .. wishing there were
                example templates, but not really seeing how this would work just
                yet.. maybe just have a generic lst_xxxx.zb, etc for reference?
9:26 PM 2/16/01 thinking again about creating *.act files.. 
                meanwhile adding __name__=="__main__" line...
                (act would create an anonymous class FOR you, but how to extend?)
9:28 PM 2/16/01 setting act_ to list goals, since it's probably most common..
9:29 PM 2/16/01 running it. [first time I'm actually executing code]
9:31 PM 2/16/01 internal server error.. copying generic .weblib.py to debug
9:33 PM 2/16/01 still getting internal server error..
9:35 PM 2/16/01 uncommenting catchall lines in weblib.cgi.. 
                it blanks out screen. 
                recomment, and I get 500 error.. 
9:36 PM 2/16/01 really wishing I had a debugger!
9:37 PM 2/16/01 make test.py .. one line: 'print "hello"'
9:39 PM 2/16/01 ok.. even zikeshop is dead on that machine.
                it gives: 
                _mysql.OperationalError: (1030, 'Got error 127 from table handler')
9:41 PM 2/16/01 still get it after shutting down MySQL.. this isn't good.
9:43 PM 2/16/01 bizarre.. web_sess ran out of space or got corrupted or something.
                "DELETE FROM web_sess" fixed it though....
                delete test.py, back to admin/index.py
9:45 PM 2/16/01 successfully shows contents of lst_goal.zb!! (a single word)
                restroom break
9:48 PM 2/16/01 populating ZikePlanAdminApp.what..
                package is called buggernaut, but I want it to be called zikeplan.
                i know that'll screw things up for now so I make a fake module called 
                zikeplan.py that just does import * from buggernaut
9:50 PM 2/16/01 ran index.py - broke because no db set up.. updating .weblib.py
9:51 PM 2/16/01 wishing zdc.drivers.DBAPI2Driver.DBAPI2Driver  was simpler
9:53 PM 2/16/01 ICK! Can't do zikebase.load("Node") without defining base_node.
                That really sucks.
                For now, will add table (base_content, too). 
                Later, clean this up!!
9:58 PM 2/16/01 had to fix a template problem in all the zdcRecordObject classes.
                fixed the template.
                REALLY need to make RecordObject._table just a string.
9:59 PM 2/16/01 updating blog
10:04 PM 2/16/01 editing lst_goal... tried * for list, but list isn't defined.
10:07 PM 2/16/01 list isn't defined because .qry_goal not defined. 
                 @TODO: pprint.pprint(scope) reveals this:
 'errors': [{'error': 's'},
            {'error': 'e'},
            {'error': 'l'},
            {'error': 'f'},
            {'error': '.'},
            {'error': 'q'},
            {'error': 'r'},
            {'error': 'y'},
            {'error': '_'},
            {'error': 'g'},
            {'error': 'o'},
            {'error': 'a'},
            {'error': 'l'},
            {'error': '('},
            {'error': ')'},
            {'error': ' '},
            {'error': 'n'},
            {'error': 'o'},
            {'error': 't'},
            {'error': ' '},
            {'error': 'd'},
            {'error': 'e'},
            {'error': 'f'},
            {'error': 'i'},
            {'error': 'n'},
            {'error': 'e'},
            {'error': 'd'}], 
10:08 PM 2/16/01 defining qry_goal
10:10 PM 2/16/01 where did zdc.ObjectView.py go???!?!?! 
                 somehow got deleted. 
		 cvs update fixed it.
10:13 PM 2/16/01 this is WAY UNINTUITIVE ... ObjectView should be automatic,
                 or should at least be possible without map():

    def qry_goal(self):
        return map(zdc.ObjectView, zikebase.dbc.select(zikeplan.Goal))

10:14 PM 2/16/01 adding "add new" button..
10:15 PM 2/16/01 not showing error messages (because of, I know..)
10:17 PM 2/16/01 added exit routine to print errors:
      ['f', 'r', 'm', '_', 'g', 'o', 'a', 'l', ' ', 't', 'e', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'a', 't', 'e', ' ', 'n', 'o', 't', ' ', 'f', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd'] 
10:17 PM 2/16/01 really wish I had a generic frm_new page..
10:18 PM 2/16/01 zebra ought to have for @fields or something, where @ is special group..
10:20 PM 2/16/01 times are off between my two machines, 
                 so I have to delete *.zb every time I update.. argh..
10:21 PM 2/16/01 added simple goal editor (name only - ignoring hierarchy stuff for now)
10:21 PM 2/16/01 adding navigation.. put call to dsp_head in .enter()
                 shouldn't that be OnEnter() ??
10:25 PM 2/16/01 wishing zebra didn't chomp up whitespace inside stripes...
10:28 PM 2/16/01 generic label pages..
10:28 PM 2/16/01 actually, now that I think about it, qry_XXX should be generic..
                 it should just select ALL objects of that type.
10:32 PM 2/16/01 bit confused why status/type wouldn't edit until I realized i needed to add to .what
10:34 PM 2/16/01 updating blog.
10:37 PM 2/16/01 updating cvs
10:41 PM 2/16/01 now what?  
   [daydreaming...]
10:54 PM 2/16/01 added generic useradmin pages..
10:55 PM 2/16/01 added user m/m - got pyweb error about validation.
                 isn't it about time to stop talking about pyweb errors 
                 and call 'em weblib errors instead?
10:56 PM 2/16/01 adding call to dsp_head in Enter
10:57 PM 2/16/01 cool idea:
                 could actors be composites? maybe call 'em Ensembles?
                 then you could just add actors to the ensemble... interesting..
11:00 PM 2/16/01 updating blog
11:03 PM 2/16/01 public goal page..
                 thinking it would be great to break the list and add/edit/delete actors 
                 off from adminactor..
                 also, I always think "add" when really it's "create"... interesting..
11:06 PM 2/16/01 deciding to cheat, and break the old app down into pages..
11:09 PM 2/16/01 making TaskAdmin..
11:13 PM 2/16/01 for some odd reason, had trouble copying .weblib.py
                 why do i actually have to copy .weblib.py ??
11:15 PM 2/16/01 internal server error on attempting to create task.. why?
11:15 PM 2/16/01 editing .weblib.py doesn't help..
11:16 PM 2/16/01 uncommenting weblib.cgi gives blank screen.
11:22 PM 2/16/01 aha.. the internal server error was on submitting to index.py
                 which doesn't exist.. maybe:
                      a) forms just shouldn't have an ACTION, so they self-submit
                      b) weblib.cgi should give a 404 error, not a 500!
11:25 PM 2/16/01 task.summary ought to be => .label or .name
11:27 PM 2/16/01 updating blog - time's up.
