0215.2002 Sixthday Vision statement

              my software goals


Sixthday is another step on the evolutionary ladder to a system for
developing software applications for the web.  This system started
with the plans for zikeshop a long time ago, and has been slowly
evolving ever since.

I've come a long way. I've learned so much about programming, and yet,
in retrospect, I've not produced much software. What I have produced
is a pretty darn good programmer. Me. I'm certainly not the best out
there, but I'm good. So what am I doing with it?

Web programming is probably my strongest skill, of everything I know
how to do. But I don't do much web programming. I started cornerhost
so I could have time to build the programs I wanted to build. Yet I'm
not doing it. How strange.

Well, so what?

I don't know.

The tools I have... sdunit, cvs, leo, sixthday... They should allow me
to work on many projects simultaneously. So it would be nice to be
able to allocate two hours to a particular project, and just be able
to sit down with my issue tracker and work on whatever's at the top of
the list for that project.

It would also be nice to incorporate some reporting.. Like a
timesheet, so I can see how much time I spent on a particular issue,
or a particular project.

Can I have this? I'm envisioning some enhancements to buggernaut.
Possibly rewriting it to use metakit and wxwindows.

Here would be a list of stories:

  - left side shows tree of projects/goals
  - bulk of window shows a list of bugs.
  - click bug to see history
  - double click to pop up new window
  - users can add new goals
  - users can add time to a goal
  - users can estimate time spent on goal (gantt)
  - data is stored in a database of some kind

I think this is the thing I should be working on, along with
duckbill, a control panel, linkwatcher, etc.. It's precisely
BECAUSE I have so much on my plate that I need a tool like
this. 

Interesting. Most tools let many people work on one project.
I need a tool to help me work on many projects.
