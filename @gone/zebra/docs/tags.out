** tag name="body"
*** desc
The innermost part of a @@report@@ or @@group@@.
The body stripe is repeated for each 
record in the results.
*** example
\* report
\** query source="myDB"
select item from table
\** body
&lt;li&gt;{item}
** tag name="content"
*** desc
This is a prenamed stripe for use by content authors.
It simply marks its children as being the actual content
of a page.
*** example
\* title
A story.
\* content
Once upon a time, something happened. The end.
** tag name="description"
*** desc
A prenamed stripe that marks its children as being
the description of a page (to be inserted into an HTML META
tag, for example)
*** example
\* title
A story
\* description
A humorous tale of love, adventure, and danger.
\* content
Once upon a time, something happened. The end.
** tag name="ef"
*** desc
A logic tag that implements an "else if".
Must follow an @@if@@.
*** example
\* if native="$x > 50"
Too low.
\* ef native="$x < 50"
Too high.
\* el native="$x = 50"
Just right!
*** attr name="native" desc="Allows for testing in the native language. Disallowed in safe mode."
*** attr name="test" desc="A test in ZebraScript. Will be translated to the native language. (not yet implemented)"
** tag name="el"
*** desc
A logic tag that implements "else". Must follow @@if@@ or @@ef@@.
See @@ef@@ for example.
*** attr name="native" desc="Allows for testing in the native language. Disallowed in safe mode."
*** attr name="test" desc="A test in ZebraScript. Will be translated to the native language. (not yet implemented)"
** tag name="eval"
*** desc
Indicates that the enclosed data is to be treated as 
(python) code to be evaluated at compile time by zebra. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The eval tag may be used to build stripes on the fly.
Simply populate a variable called STRIPE. If STRIPE
is set to anything other than None when the code
is finished evaluating, then a STRIPE will be inserted
into the current context. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
At some point, this tag will be used to make zebra documents
scriptable. For now it should not be used to modify the zebra document
that is being parsed, because the interface to the zebra parser will
probably change.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Note:</b> eval may not contain any other stripes, nor
will interpolation of {$variables}, {fields}, and {!stripes} 
work within an eval.
*** example
\* zebra
\** eval
# python stuff
STRIPE = "Four plus four is " + `4+4`
** tag name="exec"
*** desc
Indicates that the enclosed stripes are to be treated as executable
code to be run by the web server. For example, when making a 
PHP3 application, the PHP3 should go here.
*** example
\* zebra
This gets shown.
\** exec
print "And so does this"; # assuming PHP3, perl, etc..
** tag name="group"
*** desc
Group implements headers and footers in a @@report@@.
May be nested inside another group.
Its "head" is shown whenever the content of the current record's
grouping field is different from that of the previous
record. Its "tail" is shown whenever the content of the current record's
grouping field is different from that of the next record.
See @@report@@ for an example.
*** attr name="field" desc="The field on which to group."
** tag name="head"
*** desc
A header. The part of a @@skin@@, @@report@@, or @@group@@ tag that
gets shown before the contents of the stripe.
** tag name="if"
*** desc
A logic tag that implements an "if". May be used with @@ef@@ and
@@el@@ to produce complex conditional logic. May be nested.
*** example
X is definitely 
\* if test="not {xIsTrue}"
NOT
\* show
true.
*** attr name="native" desc="Allows for testing in the native language. Disallowed in safe mode."
*** attr name="test" desc="A test in ZebraScript. Will be translated to the native language. (not yet implemented)"
** tag name="include"
*** desc
Include one zebra file within another.
*** example
\* include file="bubba.zi"
*** attr name="file" desc="the name of the file to be included. Conventionally, *.zi"
** tag name="insert"
*** desc
Inserts a named stripe. Empty tag, so it requires a "/".
May (and should) be abbreviated with {!stripename}
*** example
\* zebra
\** stripe name="fred"
This is fred
\** show
Here's fred:
\*** insert stripe="fred" /
Here's fred again: {!fred}
*** attr name="stripe" desc="the name of the stripe"
** tag name="keywords"
*** desc
A prenamed stripe to contain keywords for describing a document. Used, for example,
to populate the "description" META tag in HTML.
*** example
\* title
A story.
\* keywords
adventure, story, stories, plot
\* content
Once upon a time, something happened. The end.
** tag name="none"
*** desc
In a @@report@@, this stripe is displayed if the @@query@@ returns no records.
*** example
\* report
\** query
select something from table where (1=2)
\** head
This won't ever get shown.
\** body
Neither will this.
\** none
Nothing shown because 1 never equals 2.
** tag name="report"
*** desc
The report tag generates code to format the results of a @@query@@. 
*** example
\* zebra
\** report
\*** query source="myDB"
select person, department from employees order by department
\*** group field="department"
\**** head
People in the {department} department:
&lt;ul&gt;
\**** body
&lt;li&gt;{person}
\**** tail
&lt;/ul&gt;
*** attr name="query" desc="a (predefined) query to use (optional, not yet implemented)"
** tag name="show"
*** desc
Indicates that the enclosed data is meant to be shown to
the web browser. Often translates into a "print" statement,
depending on the language. Mostly used to avoid a "* /"
for @@exec@@ or @@eval@@, since zebra is in "show" context
by default.
*** example
\* zebra
in show context
\** exec
print "in exec context";
\** show
back in show context.
** tag name="skin"
*** desc
Defines a skin for wrapping stripes.
*** example
\* skin name="brackets"
\** head
[[[[[[
\** tail
]]]]]]]
\* wrap skin="brackets"
This will be in brackets.
*** attr name="name" desc="the name of the skin"
** tag name="stripe"
*** desc
A mechanism for naming stripes.
*** example
\* zebra
\** stripe name="fred"
This is the stripe called "Fred".
\** show
Here's fred: {!fred}
*** attr name="name" desc="the name of the stripe"
** tag name="tail"
*** desc
A footer. The part of a @@skin@@, @@report@@, or @@group@@ tag that
gets shown after the contents of the stripe.
** tag name="title"
*** desc
A prenamed stripe to contain title of a document. Used, for example,
to populate the TITLE tag in HTML.
*** example
\* title
A story.
\* keywords
adventure, story, stories, plot
\* content
Once upon a time, something happened. The end.
** tag name="wrap"
*** desc
Wraps the enclosed stripe in a skin. See @@skin@@ for example.
*** attr name="skin" desc="the name of the skin to use"
** tag name="zebra"
*** desc
Top level tag. Indicates that this is a Zebra file.
*** example
\* zebra
hello, world!
