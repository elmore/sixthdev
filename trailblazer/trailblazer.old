<h1>the trailblazer experiment</h1>

Narrative programming is like literate programming with version
control and refactoring built in. That is, instead of simply
presenting the finished parts of the program, we present instructions
for building the finished program, starting from scratch.

Trailblazer is a narrative programming tool, and it is itself written
in a narrative style. Unit tests and code are woven through this
document. The document that you are reading at this very moment is the
actual source code for trailblazer. It is meant to be read from
beginning to end, like an essay.

Some of the code in this implementation is rather kludgy simply
because of the bootstrapping problem: I am attempting to use a
narrative programming style without actually having a narrative
programming tool. Instead I am leaning heavily on python's dynamic
programming features, rearranging classes and methods at runtime.

Future narrative programs, written with the help of this very tool,
will be much cleaner. :)

Let's begin.
"""

"""
<h1>Trails</h1>

A trail is just a thread of text or code chunks woven through our
narrative.

A simple trail has two parts: a head and a tail, which can be null.
For example:
"""

import unittest
class TrailTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_simple(self):
        s = Trail("hello")
        self.assertEquals("hello", str(s))

    def test_complete(self):
        s = Trail("hello", "(world)")
        self.assertEquals("hello(world)", str(s))

"""
That test will fail because we don't have trails yet. So:
"""

class Trail(object):
    def __init__(self, head, tail=""):
        self.head = head
        self.tail = tail
    
    def __str__(self):
        # stringify everything so we can use any type:
        return str(self.head) + str(self.tail)

"""
One thing you can do with trails is extend them. You extend trails
with other trails:
"""

class TrailExtensionTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_extend(self):
        s = Trail("HEAD[","]TAIL")
        s.extend(Trail("head:","tail"))
        self.assertEquals("HEAD[head:tail]TAIL", str(s))


"""
This test fails because we haven't implemented Trail.extend.

At this point, we have a bootstrap problem because we actually need
the feature we're implementing. Do you see it? We've already defined
the Trail class. Now we want to add a method. Now, it would be pretty
easy for me, as I write this, to just jump back a few lines in my text
editor and add the method to the Trail class. That's how programming
normally works.

But the point of the narrative approach is to explain how the code
works in little chunks. If I were sitting with you at a computer and
trying to demonstrate this idea, I'd introduce a problem in the form
of a test case, explain why it fails, and then present the solution by
going back and editing the code.

So there's our conflict: I want to edit the class, which would
normally lead me to scroll up there in my editor and change it
directly, but that would break the narrative flow.

Thankfully python lets us add a method to a class after the fact.  All
we have to do is define a freestanding function and glue it onto the
class:
"""

def _Trail_extend(self, other):
    self.head=Trail(self.head, other)
    
Trail.extend = _Trail_extend

"""
Well, that was easy enough. If python lets us do that, why bother with
trailblazer at all? Simply because we often want to do the same thing
for things besides python. For example, we might want to include
changes to the documentation in our narrative, or we might need to use
code from other languages - even multiple other languages. Trailblazer
solves the generic problem.

Anyway, with that simple change, the tests now pass. Now that we can
represent a Trail, how should we handle them?
"""

"""
<h2>TrailBlazing</h2>

To blaze a trail is to mark it so that others can follow. Before a
trail is blazed, it's no different than the surrounding landscape.
The trailblazer's job, therefore, is to scout ahead and find a good
path from the beginning to the end, and mark that path so that others
can follow.

At times, we might seem to be making progress, only to find that our
way is blocked, and that we need to backtrack and try a different
approach. Slowly, we extend the trail until we reach the goal.

When we program, we start with a problem and search for a solution.
If we don't leave a trail for others to follow, we may very well find
a solution, but we may have a hard time telling someone else where it
is. Too often, documentation (if it exists) simply describes what the
solution looks like, but never tells anyone how to get there.

Right now, we're blazing a trail for future programmers,, but our
tools are still crude. Consider:

We were able to go back and extend the Trail class because python lets
us refer to both classes and functions by name.  It's easy to add
methods to classes, but what if we wanted to add another statement to
a method? For example, if we wanted to add a plot twist to a story
written in python...
"""

def StoryExample():
    once_upon_a_time()
    the_end()

"""
... we'd have to rewrite the whole thing:
"""

def StoryExample():
    once_upon_a_time()
    something_happened()
    the_end()

"""
There's no way to tell python to just stick something in the middle
like that. In python, classes, methods, and functions are first class
citizens but individual statements are not.

Actually, we could use the <code>compiler</code> module to get at the
individual statements, but of course that would only let us deal with
python source code, and even then it would be a lot of work.

Because they are generic, Trails handle this case easily. By treating
the code as a Trail, we can create an arbitrary extension point:
"""

del StoryExample

class StoryExampleTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
        story=Trail(
            # head:
            ("def story():\n"
             "    once_upon_a_time()\n"),

            # == extension point ==
            
            # tail:
            ("    the_end()\n"))

        # now add the line:
        story.extend("    something_happened()\n")
        self.assertEquals(("def story():\n"
                           "    once_upon_a_time()\n"
                           "    something_happened()\n"
                           "    the_end()\n"),
                          str(story))
                         
        """
        Easy! 
        
        But wait a second. Suppose we want to add a foreword to our
        story, or a postscript. Since there's only one extension
        point, we're out of luck. If we call <code>story.extend</code>
        again, it'll just keep adding stuff before
        <code>the_end()</code>:
        """

        story.extend("    another_exciting_plot_twist()\n")
        story.extend("    and_so_on()\n")
        self.assertEquals(("def story():\n"
                           "    once_upon_a_time()\n"
                           "    something_happened()\n"
                           "    another_exciting_plot_twist()\n"
                           "    and_so_on()\n"
                           "    the_end()\n"),
                          str(story))


"""
Obviously, we're not going to get very far with only one extension
point. No problem: if we give the trails names as we add them, we can
extend the system however we like:
"""

class SolfegeExample(unittest.TestCase):
    # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfege
    def test(self):
       
        # the major scale (white keys):
        scale = Trail("[","]")
        do = Trail("C:") ; scale.extend(do)
        re = Trail("D:") ; scale.extend(re)
        mi = Trail("E:") ; scale.extend(mi)
        fa = Trail("F:") ; scale.extend(fa)
        so = Trail("G:") ; scale.extend(so)
        la = Trail("A:") ; scale.extend(la)
        ti = Trail("B:") ; scale.extend(ti)
        scale.extend("C")
        self.assertEquals("[C:D:E:F:G:A:B:C]", str(scale))

        # the chromatic scale (adds the black keys)
        di = Trail("C#:") ; do.extend(di)
        ri = Trail("Eb:") ; re.extend(ri)
        fi = Trail("F#:") ; fa.extend(fi)
        si = Trail("Ab:") ; so.extend(si)
        li = Trail("Bb:") ; la.extend(li)
        self.assertEquals("[C:C#:D:Eb:E:F:F#:G:Ab:A:Bb:B:C]", str(scale))
        

"""
This test runs fine, so, in theory, we already have the power we're
looking for.  However it would be cumbersome to write each narrative
as a python script. Ideally, we'd write the narrative in some
author-friendly markup language, and decorate the trails with blazes
(markers) as we go along. 

Here's how TrailBlazer ought to work:
"""


class SolfegeTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def makeScale(self):
        scale = TrailBlazer(Trail("[","]"))
        scale["do"] = Trail("c:")
        scale["re"] = Trail("d:")
        scale["mi"] = Trail("e:")
        scale["fa"] = Trail("f:")
        scale["so"] = Trail("g:")
        scale["la"] = Trail("a:")
        scale["ti"] = Trail("b:")
        scale["DO"] = Trail("C")
        return scale
    
    def test(self):
        self.assertEquals("[c:d:e:f:g:a:b:C]", str(self.makeScale()))

"""
It's easy enough to pass the test:
"""

class TrailBlazer(dict):
    def __init__(self, trail):
        self.trail = trail

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.trail)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        seg = TrailBlazer(value)
        self.trail.extend(seg)
        dict.__setitem__(self, key, seg)


"""
However, there is a problem at this point:
"""

bug = TrailBlazer(Trail("{","}"))
bug["foo"]=Trail("abc.")
bug["foo"]=Trail("123.")
bug["foo"]=Trail("xyz")
assert str(bug["foo"]) == "xyz"

# unfortunately:
assert str(bug) == "{abc.123.xyz}"

"""
The code lets us reassign the marker to a new trail, but the old trail
sticks around. In reality, the same thing happens with python: the old
method sticks around until it gets garbage collected.

In our case, it's not enough to simply remove the old version, because
the order in which trails are defined could be important, either for
technical or narrative reasons (eg, if we were generating reference
docs inline)

What we really want is to replace the trail if it already exists:
"""

class ReplaceTest(SolfegeTest):
    def test(self):
        scale = self.makeScale()

        # original version:
        self.assertEquals("[c:d:e:f:g:a:b:C]", str(scale))

        # change the trails:
        for note in scale:
            scale[note] = Trail(note," ")
        self.assertEquals("[do re mi fa so la ti DO ]", str(scale))

        # remove the final space:
        scale["DO"] = Trail("DO")
        self.assertEquals("[do re mi fa so la ti DO]", str(scale))

"""
Now, we want to keep the original behavior if we're blazing a trail
for the first time. We can preserve that behavior by renaming the old
<code>TrailBlazer.__setitem__</code> to <code>.blaze</code>...
"""
TrailBlazer.blaze = TrailBlazer.__setitem__

"""
... and replacing <code>__setitem__</code> with something like this:
"""

def _TrailBlazer___setitem__(self, key, value):
    if key in self:
        self.replace(key, value)
    else:
        self.blaze(key, value)
       
def _TrailBlazer_replace(self, key, value):
    self[key].trail = value

TrailBlazer.__setitem__ = _TrailBlazer___setitem__
TrailBlazer.replace = _TrailBlazer_replace

"""
We can extend any sub trail by using the qualified name.
We might also want to extend the master trail:
"""

class TrailBlazerExtendTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
        trail = TrailBlazer(Trail("[",";"))
        trail.extend("]")
        self.assertEquals(str(trail), "[];")

def _TrailBlazer_extend(self, content):
    self.trail.extend(content)

TrailBlazer.extend = _TrailBlazer_extend



"""
@TODO: implement deletion. meanwhile: trail.replace("deleted", Trail(""))
"""

"""
At this point, we have everything we need to build our trails as we go
along. But if you really think about it, you'll realize we need two
trails: one for people to follow and one for our compiler to follow.

The people trail takes the form of plain old words in our markup
language. The narrative <em>is</em> the people trail.

We also need a trail so that the computer can follow along and read
our instructions and build the final program. So far python's doing
that job, but we've had to do a lot of tedious work at runtime to make
it happen. Now that we have TrailBlazer, we can implement a something
to sniff out trails that we've defined in an external file, and lead
the compiler along after us. Let's call it a <code>BlazeHound</code>.

How a BlazeHound works kind of depends on the markup language we're
using. From the outside, all we want is to is to load a file. How we
parse that file kind of depends on what sort of markup language we
choose. We're going to implement a simple XML BlazeHound.

Let's start with a simple test:
"""

import xml.sax

def normalizeWhiteSpace(s):    
    return " ".join(str(s).split())

class BlazeHoundTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test(self):
        hound = BlazeHound()
        hound.parseString(            
            '<xml>[<trail:blaze name="abc">xyz</trail:blaze>]</xml>')
        self.assertEquals("[xyz]", normalizeWhiteSpace(hound.trail))
        self.assertEquals("xyz", normalizeWhiteSpace(hound.trail["abc"]))

"""
This is a simple test, but it actually takes quite a bit of work:
"""

class BlazeHound(xml.sax.ContentHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.this  = Trail("")
        self.trail = TrailBlazer(self.this)

    def startElement(self, name, attrs):
        # this isn't the right way to do namespaces, but
        # since we're just bootstrapping here, we'll let
        # it slide:

            self.stack.append(self.this)
            self.this = new = Trail("")
            self.trail[attrs["name"]]=new
            
    def endElement(self, name):
