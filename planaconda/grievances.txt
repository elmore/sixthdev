- weblib.RequestBuilder().build() ?!?! ick.

- MockClerk shouldn't need a DBMAP

- DBMAP format is ugly as hell

- no quick reference tutorial for mock database (shelve)
- plus it's ugly!!!

    import arlo
    import shelve
    import storage

    shelf = shelve.open("data/planaconda.shf")
    if not shelf.get("store"):
        shelf["store"] = storage.MockStorage()
    ENG.do_on_exit(shelf.close)

    store = shelf["store"]
    clerk = arlo.Clerk(store, config.DBMAP)


- i wanted clerk to let me lazy load node.parent... 
  it has the ability to do that, but there's no support
  for it. Oh wait. It IS lazy loaded! I think. Is it?
  it's not really clear. :)

- however, I shouldn't have had to touch .private for the
  mock root... :/ Or should I?


- PlanApp is an AdminApp but doesn't use any of the old and
  crappy dispatch stuff. That probably needs to be factored
  out... In fact, the only thing it DOES use is the generic_save
  which might make more sense as another ObjectEditor or BoxEditor


- "crumbs" didn't show up from zebra. it shows up in BoxView 
  on demand, but not in zebra's scope. igh... :/


- I needed Node.ID=0 but there's no easy way to tie that 
  in with arlo. Clerk should let me get a Ghost instance
  like that, specifically for querying on None.
