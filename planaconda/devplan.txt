                     PLANACONDA 1.0 PROJECT PLAN
                     ===========================

[0:00-2:00]: nodes
    borrow old node class from zikeshop
    implement front page 
        # basically "view node" but special logic for root
        # querying on status=project should be sufficient
    view node
        # same zebra template as front page (except title?) 
        # show checkboxes for plate
    add/edit node
        # simple: just use current framework
        # (sixthdev, not new platonic stuff - save that for later)
        # show dropdown for parent
        # change to parent needs to cascade down (zikeshop does this)
    tree page
        # show flattened tree with plate checkboxes and css depths
    split node
        # one form with copy of field for each side of
        # the split, all in one zebra template
        # redirect to view new original node, now with one child


[2:00-3:00]: estimates and the plate
    show plate:
        # just give it its own template
    estimates
        # just more fields to fill in
        # change in estimate cascades upward
    alter plate: 
        # take list of expected checkboxes
        # grab all the corresponding objects 
        # update each individually

[3:00-4:00]: comments
     comment list on node
     sort comments by date
     add comment to each side on split
     add comment on update node
     add comment directly from view node page
